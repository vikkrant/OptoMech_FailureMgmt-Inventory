# Tracking Inventory and Analyzing Failure for L2SI MODS Opto-Mechanical Components

## Background
Currently at LCLS there are no tools in place to keep track of opto-mechanical or optical components. This means that there is no centralized resource that keeps track of the components as they are ordered into LCLS or as they tend to break during their time at the facility (over the course of experiments or in other ways). 

This is problematic for two reasons: 
- Money: Are stages more prone to failure when compared to mounts? If a higher rate of failure is observed in a certain line of stages, is this due to a recurring manufacturing issue or can this be attributed to the environment the component exists in (hutch, upstream/downstream assets etc.)? Currently, questions like these and other related ones are unanswered leading to unfeterred flow of unchecked component failures. Consequently, replacement components are continually being ordered with prices between $2,000-8,000 resulting in a constant outflow of funds without any measures being taken to put an end to this.
- Time: Since failure is not currently analyzed, scientists are unable to prepare for component failures that might occur during the course of their experiments. The lead time to replace an opto-mechanical component is 12-18 months. So, an experiment's completion can be heavily delayed as scientists wait on replacement parts to be delivered.

To combat this, our solution is twofold:
- Tracking: Create a central space where all opto-mechanical components can be tracked, functional and broken ones
- Analyzing: Obtain characteristics about these failures 

## Tracking
[724Ready.xlsx](/724Ready.xlsx) is the central space where all the opto-mechanical component failures found over the course of this project have been recorded. Its comprises of [# Number of tickets from Dr. Berges] and [# Number of tickets from Dr. Fong]
